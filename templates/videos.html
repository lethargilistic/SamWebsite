<p>I made the <i>Damsel</i> for an assignment to make 'a brief commercial' for
a fictional company. I am not one to go halfway on anything, so I took great
pains to make sure each image looked great, got a good friend (Henrique Neves)
to voice act, and wrote up a brief rhyme to make an entire film trailer. This
was made in the first quarter of my Digital Design degree, and set the stage for
my Digital Design abilities to shine.</p>
<h2><i>Showcase</i></h2>

<p>Done just to examine my abilities in After Effects, this school assignment
included putting a bunch of images we've done into a slideshow. Naturally, these
are all old drawings of mine, some dating back several years.</p>
