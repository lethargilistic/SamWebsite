        Samantha Morstan is a writer and artist, working on any number of
        artistic and literary projects at any given time. Her current projects
        are tentatively titled <i>Theomachy</i> and Kingdom Cards, a book and
        a card game, respectively. Samantha has received Two AAs from Pierce College (one general, and
        one in Digital Design), and a BA in English (creative writing focus)
        from the University of Washington in Seattle. She has written one play

            target="_blank"><i>Doctor, Dealer, Drugged</i></a>), which was
        performed by the University of Washington's Undergraduate Theater
        Society in 2013, as a part of the New Works Festival. She had
        one picture (<i><a href="http://fav.me/d8e7tbi" target="_blank">Cubist 
        Living Statue</a></i>) in the 2015 edition of the Student
        Literary Arts Magazine at Pierce College.

        Samantha is always looking for the next creative project, and ready to
        throw herself into it. Her greatest ambition is to create things that
        delight and inspire others.
